Playground for estimating hyperbola equations from sample points.

...because this is a sub-step of determining key blank 3d geometry from a 
detailed 2d image, and what else am I supposed to be working on at 4am?

(Specifically when cutting an angle in the key profile the cut is performed by 
the frustum of a cone, forming a hyperbola on the surface of the key that can 
be measured precisely in a top-view photo. The slope of the cut on the profile 
of the key equals the slope of the asymptote of the hyperbola, and this can be 
used to determine the depth of the cut)

You're welcome, Andre.
